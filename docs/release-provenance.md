# Release Provenance 🔏

Each Fence release connects reviewed source code to the exact GitHub Action you run. Releases start only when a reviewed version bump merges into `main`.

## How A Release Is Built

1. A pull request updates the source version in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.
2. The pull request merges into protected `main` as signed commit `M`.
3. Release automation builds and attests the Linux agent from `M`.
4. GitHub creates signed distribution commit `D` with `M` as its only parent.
5. The Action acceptance tests and runner canary validate `D`.
6. The workflow publishes the immutable release and verifies it.

The distribution commit adds exactly two generated files:

```text
action/bin/fence
action/bundle-manifest.json
```

Neither file is added to `main`.

## Pin The Published Action

Each release includes `action-release.json`, which identifies the source commit, distribution commit, binary checksum, manifest version, and signing workflow.

Use its full `action_commit` value in your workflow:

```yaml
- uses: openai/fence@<action-commit> # pin@vX.Y.Z
```

Use the matching release version in the `# pin@vX.Y.Z` comment. The release notes include a ready-to-copy example, and Dependabot uses the comment when updating the pinned commit.

The release tag points to the distribution commit, but workflows should use its full commit SHA. Do not run Fence from `main`; it does not contain the Action bundle.

## Verify Release Artifacts

A release is complete only after Fence verifies its binary, manifest, checksums, build attestations, and signed `D -> M` relationship. The Action runs the verified bundled binary; it never downloads an agent or policy at runtime.

Historical releases through `v0.6.3` keep their original tag behavior. Releases through `v0.8.3` retain their original pre-transfer provenance.

See the [security policy](../SECURITY.md) for artifact verification commands and the [v0 specification](v0.md#ci-and-release-contract) for the full release contract.
